# Python-grep-Clone
Clone for grep written in Python using `argparse` and `sys`.

**Use**
To read a file and "grep" lines that match: `python grep_python.py [options] [pattern] [path/to/file]`
To read stdin and find matches you can pipe from a utility like `cat`: `cat [path/to/file] | python grep_python.py [options] [pattern]`

## Help
`python grep_python.py [-h --help]`

Still a work in progress, but has many of the options that grep does already.
